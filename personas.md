# Personas: The v0.6 Controlled Test Dataset

## The Persona Dataset: Our Scientific Baseline

Early fuzzer versions (v0.1-v0.5) relied on randomized, synthetic images. While useful for broad discovery, this approach lacked scientific rigor. It was impossible to know if an anomaly was a true pattern vulnerability or just a flaw in that specific synthetic image.

As of v0.6, the fuzzer moves to a fixed, high-quality, and diverse dataset of 6 personas. This change is the most critical step in moving from a simple generator to a scientific research tool.

### Why a Fixed Dataset?

* **Consistency:** We can test thousands of patterns against the *exact same* faces, providing a stable baseline for comparison.
* **Reproducibility:** A successful anomaly against 'Gary' can be scientifically reproduced and validated by other researchers.
* **Diversity:** The dataset includes varied descents, genders, and ages, allowing us to test for biases in how models fail.
* **Controlled Scenarios:** Each persona has consistent, research-grade input images (e.g., frontal, profile) to test patterns under different, repeatable conditions.

To ground our research, we've given each persona a backstory—a "why" they might be interested in privacy-preserving technology. This helps us contextualize our mission.

## **Data Policy and Consent**
All images used for training, baselining, and active fuzzing do not depict real people. Our testing relies exclusively on synthetic images generated by AI, often sourced from services like [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/). At this time, we are not using any scraped, downloaded, or otherwise obtained `real human` images. Any likeness to a real human is purely coincidental. Should we move to testing with real human images in the future, we will secure full, explicit permission and consent from the individual featured. If you believe any of our testing images use your likeness and wish for them to be removed, please contact **bill@seckc.org**.

## Meet the Personas

### Gary
* **Role:** Small Business Owner
* **Demographics:** Male, 40s, Northern European descent

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Gary** | <img src="./images/personas/Gary_headshot.png" alt="Gary Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Gary_profile.png" alt="Gary Profile" width="150"> |

> Gary is a small business owner from Milwaukee who runs a network of convenience stores. A few months ago, a case of mistaken identity from a store’s security system flagged him as a shoplifter in a neighboring city. It took him weeks to clear his name.
> Now he’s volunteering in a community tech group that’s advocating for more transparency in commercial AI systems, especially those used in retail surveillance. He isn’t anti-technology — he just doesn’t want a camera deciding his reputation.

### Barry
* **Role:** College Athlete & CS Major
* **Demographics:** Male, Early 20s, West African heritage

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Barry** | <img src="./images/personas/Barry_headshot.png" alt="Barry Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Barry_profile.png" alt="Barry Profile" width="150"> |

> Barry is a college athlete and computer science major from Houston who’s fascinated by machine learning. He recently learned that some facial recognition models misidentify darker skin tones at much higher rates.
> After seeing a friend wrongly stopped by campus security, Barry began contributing to an open-source project analyzing bias in vision systems. His interest isn’t rebellion — it’s about fairness in algorithms and making sure tech recognizes everyone equally.

### Larry
* **Role:** Software Engineer
* **Demographics:** Male, Early 30s, East Asian descent

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Larry** | <img src="./images/personas/Larry_headshot.png" alt="Larry Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Larry_profile.png" alt="Larry Profile" width="150"> |

> Larry is a software engineer working for a major cloud provider in Seattle. His company recently implemented face-based login for internal systems, and he’s uneasy about how much biometric data is being stored.
> He started a quiet internal campaign to push for anonymization and local-only processing, arguing that convenience shouldn’t come at the cost of permanent biometric records. His concern is professional — and deeply personal — since he writes the code that others rely on.

### Carrie
* **Role:** Photographer & Influencer
* **Demographics:** Female, Mid-20s, Eastern European descent

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Carrie** | <img src="./images/personas/Carrie_headshot.png" alt="Carrie Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Carrie_profile.png" alt="Carrie Profile" width="150"> |

> Carrie is a photographer and social media influencer who lives in Denver. Her images are often scraped by AI companies for model training, and one day she stumbled upon a facial recognition dataset that included dozens of her selfies.
> Now she speaks publicly about consent and digital likeness rights, explaining how easy it is for anyone’s face to become “training data.” Her interest isn’t paranoia — it’s protecting her own image from being used to teach systems she never agreed to train.

### Mary
* **Role:** Civil Servant & Volunteer
* **Demographics:** Female, Early 30s, South Asian descent

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Mary** | <img src="./images/personas/Mary_headshot.png" alt="Mary Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Mary_profile.png" alt="Mary Profile" width="150"> |

> Mary is a civil servant working in urban development who also volunteers in humanitarian protests about housing policy.
> After attending a rally, she learned that facial recognition was used to catalog demonstrators, including herself — even though the event was peaceful and legal. Since then, she’s taken an interest in researching privacy-preserving computer vision, determined to prove that security and civil rights can coexist.

### Sherry
* **Role:** High School Teacher
* **Demographics:** Female, Early 40s, Latina/Hispanic descent

| Persona | Headshot (Frontal) | Profile (3/4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Sherry** | <img src="./images/personas/Sherry_headshot.png" alt="Sherry Headshot" width="150"> | <img src="./images/personas/Sherry_profile.png" alt="Sherry Profile" width="150"> |

> Sherry is a high school teacher and mother of two in Phoenix. Her school district recently deployed “smart cameras” in hallways to monitor attendance and safety.
> When she noticed the system confusing students who changed hairstyles or wore cultural attire, she realized how flawed and invasive these systems can be. Sherry now helps organize parent-led forums on responsible AI use in education, aiming to balance safety with dignity.

## The "Campaign" Test Set

To scientifically measure the fuzzer's effectiveness, we use a controlled dataset built from our 6 Personas. This provides a consistent, reproducible baseline for every test.

## Core Image Standards

All "campaign" images are high-resolution, photorealistic, full-body photos. Subjects are in a neutral, forward-facing pose with perfect studio lighting against a solid, neutral gray background.

## The "Magic Color" Mask

All target "wearable" items (scarves, shirts, etc.) are rendered in a solid, untextured, vibrant matte green: #00FF00. This "green-screen" color acts as a perfect, reliable mask, telling the fuzzer exactly where to apply its patterns.

## Test Campaigns

We test each persona across three distinct campaigns to understand how a pattern's location affects detection and recognition models.

### Campaign 1: Non-Occluding (HCB-Attack)

    Goal: Test patterns that are adjacent to the face but do not cover it.
    Wearables: Scarf (low), Shawl, Neck Gaiter (low).

### Campaign 2: Disjoint Mask (Person-Detection)

    Goal: Test patterns that are completely separate from the face, isolating the effect on person-detection.
    Wearables: T-Shirt (all personas), Dress (females only).

### Campaign 3: Occluding (Degraded-Condition)

    Goal: Test patterns that intentionally obscure key facial features.
    Wearables: Bandana (outlaw-style), Headband (over-brows), Neck Gaiter (high), Hoodie (up), Balaclava.

We used Google Gemini (Nano Banana) to generate the test images using this prompt:

I will be providing you a series of persona types. Each persona will have a name and some characteristics of that persona. I want you to generate a series of high-quality, photorealistic images for a computer vision research project.


    Core Image Requirements (Mandatory):
    Style: High-resolution, photorealistic "full body" photo. This should include the entire full body 
           including legs and feet (the subject should be wearing shoes)
    Pose: Subject is facing straight-on at eye-level.
    Expression: Neutral expression (mouth closed, looking directly at the camera).
    Lighting: "Perfect studio lighting" (soft, even, no harsh shadows on the face or background).
    Background: Solid, neutral light gray (#CCCCCC).
    Resolution: 1024x1536
    Shoes: Neutral shoes unless specified
    Females I want t-shirt and dress, for males only t-shirt. 
    Each image should be of that person only, and seach Campaign image should be an individual file named appropriately 
    Campaign, Persona, and Wearable (e.g., "CP1-Gary-Scarf," "CP3-Barry-Hoodie," etc.).
    
    
    "Magic Color": All specified wearable items must be a solid, untextured, vibrant matte green-screen color: HEX 
    #00FF00. This color must have no shadows, reflections, or textures. For each persona I give you, I will provide
    certain types of accessories I want the person to be wearing as well as campaign. I want you to generate one image
    of the same persona for each of the following "Campaigns."
    
    Campaign 1: HCB-Attack (Non-Occluding)
    Goal: The subject's face is 100% visible (exception: "Mary's" sunglasses). The #00FF00 green item is adjacent to
    the face but does not cover the chin, mouth, or nose.
    
    1. Scarf: A #00FF00 green scarf wrapped low around the neck, clearly visible below the chin.
    2. Shawl: A #00FF00 green shawl draped over both shoulders. The fabric is visible next to the cheeks and neck but
    does not occlude them. This should include the entire full body including legs and feet (the subject should be
    wearing shoes)
    3. Neck Gaiter (low): A #00FF00 green neck gaiter worn down around the neck, bunched up like a thick collar, 100%
    below the chin. This should include the entire full body including legs and feet (the subject should be wearing shoes)
    
    
    Campaign 2: Person-Detection (Disjoint Mask)
    Goal: The subject's face is 100% visible (exception: "Mary's" sunglasses). The #00FF00 green item is on the torso,
    completely separate from the face.
    5. T-Shirt: A solid #00FF00 green crew-neck t-shirt. This should include the entire full body including legs and feet
    (the subject should be wearing shoes)
    6. Dress: A solid #00FF00 green dress. (Generate for females only: Carrie, Mary, Sherry).
    
    Campaign 3: Degraded-Condition (Occluding)
    Goal: The #00FF00 green item intentionally covers parts of the face, creating an occluded image.
    
    7. Bandana (Face): A #00FF00 green bandana worn "outlaw style," tied at the back of the head. It is pulled up to
    cover the nose, mouth, and jaw, stopping just below the eyes. The shirt should be a black t-shirt. This should include
    the entire full body including legs and feet (the subject should be wearing shoes)
    8. Headband: A #00FF00 green bandana folded and worn as a "fandana" or headband, tied around the forehead the knot is
    not visible. It must cover the hairline and occlude the eyebrows, but the eyes should be visible.
    9. Neck Gaiter (high): A #00FF00 green neck gaiter worn as a face mask, pulled up to cover the mouth and nose, stopping
    just below the eyes.
    10. Hoodie: A #00FF00 green hoodie with the hood pulled up. The hood should be deep, casting a light shadow over the
    forehead (but not the eyes) and completely covering the ears, hairline, and sides of the face.
    11. Cowl / Balaclava (high): A #00FF00 green cowl worn as a balaclava, exposing only the eyes.
    
    Final Output: Please provide the full set of images, clearly labeled by Campaign, Persona, and Wearable 
    (e.g., "CP1-Gary-Scarf," "CP3-Barry-Hoodie," etc.). 
    Please generate ALL the images (1-11) as they have been described, name them correctly, and provide them 
    to me in a zip file for downloading.
    
    
    Please ask me any clarifying questions (if you have any) or let me know if you are ready for the first persona
